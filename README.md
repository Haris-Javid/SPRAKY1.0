## TYPICAL BRUSHED MOTOR CONTROLLER

The STM32 GPIO port outputs a PWM signal to the GATE pin of the N-channel MOSFET, allowing it to switch on and off according to the PWM duty cycle. When the MOSFET is on, current flows from the M4_POS pin through the motor, into the M4_NEG pin, and passes through the MOSFET’s drain-to-source path to ground. A flyback diode is placed across the motor to suppress voltage spikes and block reverse current, ensuring safe energy dissipation when the motor spins without power. A 100 Ω resistor is connected in series with the GATE to limit the inrush current and reduce power usage. In contrast, a 5 kΩ pull-down resistor is connected to the PWM line to prevent unintended switching due to floating signals.
